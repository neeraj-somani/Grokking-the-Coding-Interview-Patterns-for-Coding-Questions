# What is 2 pointer technique:

Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition.

## Ways to identify when to use the Two Pointer method:

- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

## Here are some problems that feature the Two Pointer pattern:

- Squaring a sorted array (easy)
- Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
- Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)
