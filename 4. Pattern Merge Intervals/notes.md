## What is the pattern
The Merge Intervals pattern is an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. 
In a lot of problems involving intervals, you either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

- you can solve a wide range of problems from inserting intervals to optimizing interval merges using this pattern.

## How do you identify when to use the Merge Intervals pattern?

- If you’re asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
- If you hear the term “overlapping intervals”.

## Merge interval problem patterns:

- Intervals Intersection (medium)
- Maximum CPU Load (hard)
