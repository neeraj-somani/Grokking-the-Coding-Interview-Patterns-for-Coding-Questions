## What is this pattern
This pattern deals with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.
The Cyclic Sort pattern iterates over the array one number at a time, and if the current number you are iterating is not at the correct index, you swap it with the number at its correct index.

(I think we iterate over the array again and again, until all numbers in an array in correct place, in this way we use only O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity).
Need to understand this more.

## How do I identify this pattern?

- They will be problems involving a sorted array with numbers in a given range
- If the problem asks you to find the missing/duplicate/smallest number in an sorted/rotated array

## Problems featuring cyclic sort pattern:

- Find the Missing Number (easy)
- Find the Smallest Missing Positive Number (medium)
